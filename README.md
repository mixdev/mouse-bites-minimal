A minimal, ready to use 2x4mm Mouse Bites footprint. No need of drawing or removing anything extra after placing the footprint on your design. 

Panelization allows multipele PCBs to be produced together reducing overall production turnaround time. One of the ways to panelize a PCB is to use a technique called Mouse Bites. It is by creating small, perforated tabs along the edges of the board - allows easy seperation by snapping apart the PCB by hand or basic snipping tools. This footprint is tested with KiCad 9. It has an automatic edgecut which is compatible with 2mm drillbit that most fabrication houses use.
