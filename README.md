A minimal 2x4mm ready to use Mouse Bites footprint. Panelization allows multipele PCBs to be produced together. One of the ways to panelize a PCB is to use a technique called Mouse Bites. It allows perforated tabs along the edges of the board - allows easy seperation by breaking apart the PCB by hand. This footprint is tested on KiCard 9. It has an automatic edgecut which is compatible with 2mm drillbit that most fabrication houses use.
